# 🦸‍♂️ Superhero OOP & Polymorphism Demo

A fun and educational Python project demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like:
- ✅ Classes and Objects
- ✅ Inheritance
- ✅ Encapsulation
- ✅ Polymorphism

Perfect for beginners learning Python OOP!

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project features:
- A `Superhero` base class with attributes and methods
- Two child classes: `IronMan` and `BlackWidow`
- A **polymorphism demo** with animals and vehicles
- Interactive simulation showing how different objects behave uniquely

## 🏗️ OOP Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Inheritance** | `IronMan` and `BlackWidow` inherit from `Superhero` |
| **Encapsulation** | Private attributes (e.g., `__suit_color`) with getters/setters |
| **Polymorphism** | Different classes override the same method (`move()`, `intro()`) |
| **Constructors** | Each object is initialized with unique values using `__init__()` |

## 🎭 Polymorphism Challenge

The project includes two polymorphism demos:
1. **Animals** — Each animal moves differently:  
   🐕 Dog runs, 🐦 Bird flies, 🐟 Fish swims, etc.
2. **Vehicles** — Each vehicle moves uniquely:  
   🚗 Car drives, ✈️ Plane flies, ⛵ Boat sails, etc.

A polymorphic function `demonstrate_movement(obj)` works with **any object** that has a `move()` method — showing the power of polymorphism!
